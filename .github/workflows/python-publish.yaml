        # This action bootstraps pants and manages 2-3 GHA caches.
        # See: github.com/pantsbuild/actions/tree/main/init-pants/
        with:
          # v0 makes it easy to bust the cache if needed
          # just increase the integer to start with a fresh cache
          gha-cache-key: v0
          # The Python backend uses named_caches for Pip/PEX state,
          # so it is appropriate to invalidate on lockfile changes.
          named-caches-hash: ${{ hashFiles('python-default.lock') }}
          # If you're not using a fine-grained remote caching service (see https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/remote-caching),
          # then you may also want to preserve the local Pants cache (lmdb_store). However this must invalidate for
          # changes to any file that can affect the build, so may not be practical in larger repos.
          # A remote cache service integrates with Pants's fine-grained invalidation and avoids these problems.
          cache-lmdb-store: 'true'  # defaults to 'false'
          # Note that named_caches and lmdb_store falls back to partial restore keys which
          # may give a useful partial result that will save time over completely clean state,
          # but will cause the cache entry to grow without bound over time.
          # See https://pants.readme.io/docs/using-pants-in-ci for tips on how to periodically clean it up.
          # Alternatively you change gha-cache-key to ignore old caches.
